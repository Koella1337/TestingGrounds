## Testing Grounds

Testing Grounds is a Hunger-Games inspired 1st-person-shooter made following the [Unreal Engine Developer Course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse).

The player will go through different procedurally generated levels called "Testing Grounds".
He can either sneak through a Testing Ground or kill all the AI Enemies in there to get to the next Testing Ground.

The goal is to complete as many Testing Grounds as possible before dying.
